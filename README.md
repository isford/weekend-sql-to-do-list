# Weekend SQL To Do List

## Description

_Duration: 12 Hours_

This project took approximately 12 hours. I set out to create a useable app that can be used for a to do list. The information is stored on a server, updates when tasks are completed. And they can also be deleted.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` in your terminal
5. Navigate to `localhost:5000` to open the to do list and begin adding items
